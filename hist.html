    <h2>The Final Paper and Exam</h2>
    <p>I have both a Final Paper for this class and a Final Exam.</p>
    <div></div>
    <h3>The Paper</h3>
    <p>My paper was an analysis about "In the Heart of the Sea." I already turned it in and I feel confident in both my analysis and citations.</p>
    <div></div>
    <h4>Intro Paragraph:</h4>
    <p>Nantucket during the 19th century was a perfect example of New England-American 
        temperaments and ideologies of the time. The harbor town, composed of white, religious, bigoted, and 
        capitalist people, constructed an economy and society centered entirely within their worldview, resulting 
        in inefficient and exploitative means of survival. The Essex, likewise, followed within the methodical 
        system, as seen in both its everyday routine as well as its tragic ending. Western mythology and 
        capitalism are to blame for both the tragedy and the moral crimes committed at the hands of the crew, as 
        seen in its conservative beliefs, unsustainable hierarchy, and means of conquest. </p>

    <h3>The Exam</h3>
    <p>My Final Exam is going to pick up from the last exam and will cover the material up into 1865 and the very end of the Civil War. I barely studied for the last exam and I did well so I should be fine for this one (knock on wood).</p>
