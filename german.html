<h2>The Final Paper</h2>
<p>I only had a Final Paper for this class. But it was 2000 words so that was pretty tough.</p>

<h3>The Paper</h3>

<p>My paper was an analysis about "Universal Basic Income." I already turned it in and I feel confident in both my analysis and citations. I have never writen this much before.</p>

<h4>Intro Paragraph:</h4>
<p><font color="white">The Western World, following the COVID-19 pandemic, has experienced a 
    socioeconomic paradigm shift, with the alienating lockdown policies causing the world to reflect 
    on both themselves and society as a whole. We can more critically view our politicians, our 
    economy, and our social values through the lenses of our neighbors and our former adversaries, 
    regardless of class. This paradigm shift has perpetuated “radical” and unorthodox policies and 
    ideas to take a foothold in Western capitalist nations. For example, social democratic and 
    socialist platforms are rising in popularity in the United States, even though the demonization 
    and social “book-burning” was McCarthyism. One of these proposed ideas is that of Universal 
    Basic Income (UBI.) Though a concept that has existed for decades, originating from centuries 
    of socio economic advancements, Andrew Yang, the former presidential candidate, had proposed 
    this policy as a compromise between capitalism and socialism. Yang and UBI is reflective of 
    both the historical class antagonism, the current Overton Window paradigm shift, and how 
    compromise is the equilibrium of political change. </font></p>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p><font color="white">The following is a reflection of my personal opinions about Universal Basic Income and 
    how they changed: I think it is important to be honest about subconscious biases. Going into this 
    research paper, I had previously considered voting for Andrew Yang if I were ever given the 
    chance to, that I found his UBI proposal to be a comforting progressive change, without radical 
    and tonedeaf changes with little to no plausibility of success. My opinions about Andrew Yang 
    have become more optimistic and I find myself more comfortable with the idea of UBI than 
    before, though I don’t think it's obviously a “fix-all” solution. What I didn't realize is almost how 
    genius his political marketing and strategy is, considering how history typically crowns this sort 
    of political strategy king. I’ve learned from my historical analysis that though progress is great 
    and we should never let up in our fight for a politically sound and cohesive world, compromises 
    are strategically an “okay” thing to employ. Yes, it is unfortunate that we have to compromise 
    with evil from time to time, but if you’re willing to sacrifice short term security and sometimes 
    even safety in your fight for equality, surely short-term compromises are reasonable. I have also 
    come to the conclusion that without something like UBI, without compromise, we will be in an 
    endless deadlock with our adversaries and no progress will be made at all. </font></p>
